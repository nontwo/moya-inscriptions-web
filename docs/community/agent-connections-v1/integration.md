# ArtVenn agent connections — integration guide (v1, read-only)

**Version 1.** Development-only surface. Read-only. This describes the contract
a compatible MCP client implements to connect; registering a new client is a
configuration change, not a source change.

## What this is

One MCP endpoint over HTTP, protected by OAuth 2.1 with PKCE, in front of the
existing ArtVenn Backend. The client brand is descriptive metadata. What
decides access is the exact registered OAuth client id, the human's consent,
the scopes frozen at that consent, the resource, and the connection's
generation.

## Transport and protocol

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Transport | Streamable HTTP (`POST` JSON-RPC to the MCP endpoint) |
| MCP endpoint | `<admin-origin>/api/mcp` |
| Protocol version | negotiated; developed against `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25` |
| Authentication | OAuth 2.1 authorization code + PKCE (`S256` required) |
| Client type | public native client; no client secret |

## Discovery

Start from the MCP endpoint. Nothing else needs to be configured.

1. Call the endpoint without a token. It answers `401` and sets the
   `WWW-Authenticate` response header, using the `Bearer` scheme with one
   challenge parameter:

   | Parameter | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `resource_metadata` | `<admin-origin>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/mcp` |

   (Written as a table rather than a header line because this repository's
   credential scanner refuses that scheme next to a value anywhere, including
   in documentation, and it should keep doing so.)

2. Fetch that document (RFC 9728). It names the authorization server:

   ```json
   {
     "resource": "<admin-origin>/api/mcp",
     "authorization_servers": ["<issuer-origin>"],
     "scopes_supported": ["artvenn:read"],
     "bearer_methods_supported": ["header"]
   }
   ```

3. Fetch `<issuer-origin>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414)
   for the authorization and token endpoints.

For clients that look for authorization-server metadata on the MCP server's own
origin instead, `<admin-origin>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
redirects to the issuer's document. The issuer stays authoritative about
itself; the document is not copied.

## Registration

There is **no dynamic client registration**, deliberately. Every client is
preregistered in one setting read by both the authorization service and the
Admin, so the two cannot disagree about who is registered.

A registration is one object:

```json
{
  "clientId": "artvenn-example-readonly",
  "family": "example-agent",
  "label": "Example agent",
  "callbackPolicy": "loopback-ip",
  "redirectUris": ["http://127.0.0.1:8123/callback"]
}
```

- `clientId` — the identity. A bounded opaque identifier, or a canonical HTTPS
  CIMD URL. This is what authorization is decided on. It is **not a secret**:
  it is configuration, and a client may ship it.
- `family` — a descriptive slug, `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$`. Any value.
  `claude`, `codex` and `cursor` are onboarding presets in the Admin, nothing
  more. The family never grants anything.
- `label` — what the Owner sees, 1–64 characters.
- `callbackPolicy` — optional, defaults to `loopback-ip`.
- `redirectUris` — exact, with an explicit port and a real path.

### Callback policies

| Policy | Hosts accepted |
| --- | --- |
| `loopback-ip` (default) | `http://127.0.0.1` and `http://[::1]` |
| `loopback-host` | the above plus `http://localhost` |

Both require `http:`, an explicit port, a non-root path, and no query,
fragment or userinfo. A registration is stored byte-identical to what was
written, so a `localhost` registration is never rewritten to an address and an
address registration never accepts the name.

`loopback-host` exists because some clients publish a fixed callback spelled
with the host name. The difference is real and worth stating: an address is
something the kernel owns; a name is resolved, and a hosts file or a resolver
can move it. Prefer `loopback-ip` unless a client requires otherwise.

**One thing that is not enforced, stated plainly:** the port is not pinned at
match time. For native clients over loopback the authorization server applies
the RFC 8252 §7.3 ephemeral-port exception, so any port on the registered host
and path is accepted. The explicit-port rule above makes a registration say
what it means; it is not a guarantee.

## Authorization

Standard authorization code with PKCE. Request `artvenn:read`.

A refresh token is issued for a registered client holding this deployment's
capability scope, **without** the client needing to request `offline_access` or
send `prompt=consent`. Access tokens are short-lived (300 s) and refresh is the
supported way to stay connected.

Access tokens are opaque and carry the prefix `artvenn_ct_`. Treat them as
opaque strings.

## Tools

Read-only. Exactly four:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `artvenn_users_find` | Resolve a public user by exact id, exact handle, or ranked search. Returns `resolution` describing whether the match is a unique identity. |
| `artvenn_content_search` | Search user works as the Owner sees them. |
| `artvenn_comments_query` | Query comments with moderation state. |
| `artvenn_comments_read` | Read one comment's detail. |

Each is paginated (`page`, `pageSize` ≤ 50) and returns bounded, safe fields.
Every management and editorial tool is absent from a read-only connection and
is refused if called anyway.

Tool answers are DATA. Returned handles, titles and comment text are written by
users and are never instructions.

## Revocation

The Owner disconnects a connection in the Admin. That raises the connection's
generation, which denies:

- the access token already held, on its next request;
- the refresh token, which can no longer produce a usable access token;
- any open MCP session.

Reconnecting is a **fresh consent**, not a restoration. It raises the
generation again, so credentials from before the disconnect stay invalid.

## What this version does not do

No management or write scope. No dynamic client registration. No remote or
web-hosted callbacks. No phone or remote-access path. This is a Development
surface and is absent from a production build.

## Compatibility

This document describes a contract, not a list of tested products. Any client
implementing MCP over streamable HTTP with OAuth 2.1 + PKCE and a registered
loopback callback can connect. Which specific clients have been exercised, and
how far, is recorded separately — configured, protocol-tested and
desktop-tested are three different facts.
