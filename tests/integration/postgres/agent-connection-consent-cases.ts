 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141 r15 §5) — the browser consent transaction.
 *
 * The property under test is not "a form posts". It is that an interaction
 * uid, which travels in a URL and proves nothing, only becomes a grant after
 * an authenticated human produced a secret this server rendered to THEM.
 *
 * The row has two writers and they are deliberately incapable of each other's
 * half: the provider states what it will enforce, the control plane states who
 * decided. The role cases at the end apply the REAL grant file rather than a
 * re-typed copy, because a grant plan only ever tested in paraphrase is a
 * grant plan nobody has tested.

     * The review that found the acceptance harness leaking roles was right
     * about the harness, which generated a NEW pair per run and accumulated
     * thirty. This suite is the other case: `grant-authorization.sql` creates
     * them `IF NOT EXISTS`, so the cluster holds exactly three however often
     * this runs.
     *
     * Dropping them from an `afterAll` was tried and reverted, for a reason
     * worth stating precisely because I first got it wrong: `DROP OWNED BY`
     * revokes privileges and takes locks across the WHOLE database while
     * vitest is still running other files against it, which is cluster-wide
     * surgery from inside one concurrent suite for no benefit here.
     *
     * I originally justified the revert by saying it had broken
     * `community-postgres.test.ts`'s setup. It had not. Running the suite
     * three times unchanged afterwards gave FAIL, PASS, PASS — that
     * foreign-key collision between one file's `public_users` delete and
     * another's receipts is an intermittent pre-existing race on this local
     * disposable database, and I had attributed it to my own change from a
