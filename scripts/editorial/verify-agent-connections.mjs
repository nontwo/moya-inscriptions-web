/**
 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141 r15 §6, §10) — the Development-mode
 * acceptance harness.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY, and why it does not replace anything: the
 * committed production harness boots
 * `apps/admin/.next/standalone/apps/admin/server.js`, which hard-sets
 * `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'` before anything else runs. By then the
 * production compile has already folded away every `NODE_ENV === "development"`
 * branch, so a Development-gated surface is not "disabled" there — it is
 * ABSENT FROM THE EMITTED JAVASCRIPT. No environment variable can bring it
 * back, and forcing one would only make the harness lie.
 *
 * So this boots a real `next dev`, and the production harness stays exactly as
 * it is: it remains the evidence that these surfaces are not reachable in
 * Production. Two harnesses, two claims, neither standing in for the other.
 *
 * Everything it owns, it makes and removes: its own synthetic database, its
 * own authorization listener, its own Admin, its own browser. It never touches
 * the retained Development database, another task's container, or the shared
 * browser runner's configuration.
