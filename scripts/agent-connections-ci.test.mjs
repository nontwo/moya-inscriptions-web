 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141) — the acceptance harness is only evidence
 * if CI actually runs it.
 *
 * These assertions live in a dependency-free script test on purpose. A change
 * to `.github/workflows/` routes to the LIGHTWEIGHT job and to nothing else,
 * by the classifier's own design ("a workflow path cannot name the job an
 * edit affects"), and the lightweight entry runs every script test. So a
 * later edit that deleted the step, made it conditional, or let it fail
 * softly is caught by the one job such an edit selects. A Vitest architecture
 * test would have been selected by the `test` job, which that edit does not
 * start.
