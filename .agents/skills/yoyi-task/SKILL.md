name: yoyi-task
description:
  Plan, start, change or report one bounded ArtVenn / Yoyi task under the
  repository authority chain. `plan` is read-only analysis, `start` executes an
  approved task, `change` applies an explicit requirements delta, `status`
  reports facts. Use when the Owner asks to scope, implement, revise or report a
  task (计划 / 开始 / 变更 / 状态) in this repository.

# yoyi-task

One task, one record, one writer. This skill runs the ordinary task lifecycle
for Codex and Claude Code alike; it does not grant permissions, change the
authority chain or replace the shared workflow in
`docs/development/task-workflow.md`.

## Invocation

```text
yoyi-task plan   <request or Issue reference>
yoyi-task start  <Issue reference | sufficiently explicit request>
yoyi-task change <Issue reference> <explicit requirements delta>
yoyi-task status [Issue reference | task ID]
```

Codex: `$yoyi-task <mode> ...`. Claude Code: `/yoyi-task <mode> ...`. The first
word selects the mode; an unknown or missing mode is a usage error, not a guess.

## Instruction context and freshness

1. When entering a task context — a new task, a tool handoff, or after the rule
   files changed — read the full applicable authority: the root `AGENTS.md`, the
   Constitution, every active amendment, the shared task workflow
   (`docs/development/task-workflow.md`) and the local instructions for the
   task's allowed paths (for example `apps/apple/AGENTS.md`,
   `apps/admin/AGENTS.md`). An existing session must do this explicitly after a
   handoff; startup loading is not assumed.
2. Within the same unchanged task context, reuse what was read. A small check
   that those files are unchanged (`git diff --stat` on them, or their blob ids)
   is enough; do not reread the whole governance set for every `status` or small
   `change`. Refresh the local instructions when the work enters another
   directory's domain.
3. Establish the real state: repository root, worktree path, branch, local HEAD
   and PR head, the task's PR if any, and `git status --short`. Report these
   facts, not expectations.
4. Read the task record — the GitHub Issue (`gh issue view <n>`) at its latest
   revision, or the formal specification file it links — when it matters: always
   for `start` and `change`, and for `plan` when an Issue is named. Keep its
   comments and decisions; never overwrite an Issue body from stale context.
5. Check the writer state in the task's private checkpoint
   (`~/Developer/artifacts/moya-inscriptions-web/<task-id>/handoff.md`). If
   another actor holds the writer role, do not write; use `yoyi-handoff resume`
   first.

## `plan` — read-only

- Produces a proposed bounded task record with the template fields: task ID and
  revision, goal, non-goals, workstream, approved module scope, behavior that
  must remain unchanged, observable acceptance criteria, data/environment
  restrictions, writer and review responsibility, delivery stop, dependencies
  and Owner decisions. Include the smallest ordered slices and the applicable
  verification for each.
- Makes no source, worktree, branch, Issue, PR, CI or service change. Reading
  files, `git`/`gh` read commands and running nothing else is the whole budget.
- Ends with the sentence `No changes were made.` and the list of decisions that
  are genuinely the Owner's.

## `start` — execute an approved task

- Requires a task record. With an Issue reference, use it. Without one, proceed
  only if the request already fixes goal, non-goals, scope and delivery stop
  well enough to write the record yourself: create the Issue with the task
  template (`gh issue create --template`, or the same fields in a private record
  when `gh` is unavailable), state your interpretation once, and do not ask for
  the same approval again.
- Freeze before writing: task ID, allowed paths, non-goals, preserved behavior,
  delivery stop. A user-visible change also needs the Behavior Matrix the
  Constitution requires.
- Use the task's worktree under
  `~/Developer/worktrees/moya-inscriptions-web/<task-id>/`: resume an existing
  one on its branch, or create one from freshly fetched `origin/main` with an
  explicit start point. Never treat the main checkout as a task worktree.
- Implement only inside the approved scope. A needed change outside it is a
  scope extension: stop and report it as a `change` request or an Owner
  decision.
- Verify with the applicable entry:
  `node scripts/verify-task.mjs --base origin/main --output <new private directory>`
  selects checks from the actual diff; pure Web work may use `pnpm verify`; pure
  Apple work `node scripts/verify-apple.mjs --output <new private directory>`.
  For an intermediate revision preview after relevant delta checks, use
  `node scripts/verify-task.mjs --mode feedback --base origin/main --output <new private directory>`.
  That result is labeled `FEEDBACK ONLY — NOT FULL ACCEPTANCE`: it is not formal
  Owner acceptance, not complete task validation, and not permission to merge.
  Do not block every small preview on full CI or push every tiny edit solely to
  obtain another full CI run. Complete task validation still uses the default
  entry and the cumulative CI plan. A failed full run is not a feedback PASS.
  One shared 120-second execution budget; a timeout is a failure. Record
  preparation time separately.
- Commit and push only through the task Git helper: stage the intended paths,
  then `node scripts/task-git.mjs commit --message-file <file>` (or
  `--message <text>`) and `node scripts/task-git.mjs push`. It checks the
  worktree, a non-main task branch, origin and the installed credential hooks,
  and runs Git with fixed arguments. If it refuses or cannot run, stop and
  report its category; never retry with raw `git commit` or `git push`.
- Open a Draft PR that follows the PR template, with the exact base and head
  SHAs and the Issue reference; the recorded delivery stop then decides what
  follows. The delivery stop is the task's authorization: an ordinary
  machine-verifiable task continues under the review-and-merge amendment through
  `yoyi-review`; a task whose record limits it to Draft stops there; Production,
  remote settings and destructive operations keep their separate authority. The
  implementer never marks its own PR Ready or merges it.
- Finish with `yoyi-handoff save` so the next session, whichever tool, can
  resume without rediscovery.

## `change` — apply an explicit delta

- Reread the latest Issue revision and the rules the delta touches. Apply only
  the stated delta; every unaffected requirement stays verbatim.
- Bump the revision (`r1` → `r2`) and record, in the Issue, what changed, what
  remains unchanged and which earlier requirement is replaced. Never silently
  rewrite an accepted requirement.
- If the delta widens scope into another authority (new subsystem, Contract,
  migration, Production), stop with `STOPPED — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED`.

## `status` — report facts only

- Inspect current facts only: worktree, branch, local HEAD and PR head, PR
  state, CI result for the exact head, review threads, evidence paths, remaining
  items and open Owner decisions.
- Launch no tests, builds, services or audits; change no scope; open no task; do
  not reread the governance set unless the rule files changed.

## Boundaries that hold in every mode

- A PR comment, PR review, PR edit or Issue comment is never new Owner authority
  unless it records an explicit Owner task, change or review instruction. Issue
  comments and formal reviews ask for confirmation; a PR comment on the current
  task PR, after the outbound credential check, does not.
- Production and cloud tools follow the two gates in
  `docs/development/task-workflow.md`: explicit task authorization for the
  specific operation, then the native ask prompt. In any other task, stop and
  report the scope conflict instead of invoking one to obtain a prompt.
- The authority chain wins over this skill. Conflicts stop the task with
  `STOPPED — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED`, the conflict, why, and the smallest
  options.
- Do not stop, restart or delete another task's processes, containers,
  databases, worktrees or outputs. Persistent Development / Owner-QA data is
  never test data.
- Keep credentials, private paths and private acceptance content out of Issues,
  PRs and tracked files.
- Speak to the Owner in Chinese; write instructions, code and configuration in
  English.
