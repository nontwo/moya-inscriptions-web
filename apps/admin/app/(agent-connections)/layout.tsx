 * The consent landing lives OUTSIDE the Payload admin shell on purpose.
 *
 * The Owner's Payload session is `SameSite=Strict`, and the provider's
 * cross-site redirect does not carry it (measured, r15). Inside `/admin`,
 * Payload would see an unauthenticated request and bounce the Owner to a login
 * page they do not need — they are already signed in; the browser simply
 * withheld the cookie on that one navigation. So the landing is a plain page
 * that authenticates nobody, decides nothing, and offers one same-origin step.
 *
 * It has its own root layout because `app/(payload)/layout.tsx` is the Payload
 * shell, and a route outside that group needs one of its own.
