/**
 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141 r10) — authenticating one MCP request.
 *
 * This is the seam where a browser-consented connection becomes a restricted
 * principal. It runs on EVERY protected request, not only on initialize:
 * `resolveAccessSettings` is called per request by the plugin, so a token
 * revoked a second ago is refused on the next tool call rather than at the
 * next handshake.
 *
 * Four rules hold here and are each covered by a regression:
 *
 *  1. A credential that claims to be ours succeeds on its own terms or is
 *     refused. It never falls back to the legacy API-key resolver, to an
 *     Owner session cookie, or to anonymous access.
 *  2. Every binding on the token is checked against the connection: the
 *     consenting human (`subject`), the exact registered OAuth client, the
 *     issuer, the resource, the environment and the scope set. A valid
 *     signature is not an authorization.
 *  3. What a connection may CALL is derived from its preset, never from the
 *     token's scope claim — the claim must equal the preset's canonical set,
 *     and the preset then decides the tools. A token can neither widen its
 *     connection nor silently narrow it.
 *  4. The connection's `generation` must match the token's. That is what
 *     makes disconnect effective against an unexpired token and a live
 *     session, without depending on a clock.

 * means "already parsed", not "unparsed". r14's PostgreSQL store parses every
 * row totally at the store boundary and refuses one that does not fit, which
 * is what the earlier version of this comment asked the persistence
