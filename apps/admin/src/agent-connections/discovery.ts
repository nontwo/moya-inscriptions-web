/**
 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141) — what a standards-based client is allowed
 * to learn before it has a token.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN, measured against the running services rather than reasoned
 * about: `POST /api/mcp` without a token answered `401` with NO
 * `WWW-Authenticate` header, and the Admin origin served no
 * `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and no
 * `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. The authorization server itself
 * was fully discoverable — correct metadata, S256, `none` auth method — but on
 * a DIFFERENT origin the client had no way to learn about. So every client
 * that follows the MCP authorization spec, and Cursor, which reads
 * `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` from the server's own origin,
 * reached a dead end at step one. That is the whole interoperability defect,
 * and it is fixed here at the existing seam rather than behind a gateway.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it publishes no endpoint of its own, no
 * registration endpoint, and nothing the provider does not already serve. It
 * is a signpost. Every authorization decision stays exactly where it was.
