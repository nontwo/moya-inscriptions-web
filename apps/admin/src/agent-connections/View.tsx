/**
 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141 r15 §5, §9) — the two Owner-only views.
 *
 * `AgentConsentView` is the REVIEW page: the second half of the two-step the
 * measured cookie behaviour forces. The landing outside `/admin` authenticated
 * nobody; this page does, because the human took a same-origin step of their
 * own and the browser sent the `SameSite=Strict` session with it.
 *
 * Arming happens HERE, on the server, during the render that the Owner's
 * session authenticated, and from the row the PROVIDER wrote rather than from
 * anything the request supplied.
 *
 * Be exact about what that is: it IS a write during a GET page render, and a
 * prefetch of this link would perform it. An independent review was right that
 * an earlier version of this sentence said the opposite. What makes it safe is
 * not the method but the two gates above it — the Owner check precedes it, and
 * on the cross-site navigation the `SameSite=Strict` session is absent, so a
 * prefetch from anywhere but an authenticated Admin page arms nothing.
 *
 * RE-ARMING IS NOT IDEMPOTENT, and an earlier version of this paragraph called
 * it that. The store says what it actually is, in as many words: re-arming is
 * "deliberately allowed and deliberately destructive", because reloading this
 * page mints a FRESH ticket and kills the previous one. Repeating the same SQL
 * input would be idempotent; a render that produces NEW input is not. What is
 * true is narrower and is the part that matters: it cannot touch a decided or
 * expired interaction, because `decided_at IS NULL` and the live deadline are
 * in the WHERE clause.
 *
 * THAT REASONING IS ABOUT AUTHORIZATION, AND IT MISSED A COST. The gates above
 * answer who may arm an interaction, and they still hold. None of them answers
 * what happens when this render runs TWICE for one navigation,
 * which a prefetch plus the real navigation does: `resolveConnection` was
 * read-then-create, so both renders read "no connection" and both opened one.
 * Measured on a disposable target, and reported once from the Owner
 * walkthrough — two rows for one (human, client) pair, and a pair with two
 * rows is a pair `findForClient` then refuses, so the next consent for it could
 * not succeed at all. The duplicate is closed underneath this page, in the
 * store and in migration 20260921010000, NOT here.
 *
 * SO WHAT DOES A SECOND RENDER COST, now that the connection cannot duplicate?
 * Exactly one thing: the ticket rendered into the FIRST page is dead. That is
 * survivable in the ordinary sequence and is already pinned, in
 * `agent-connection-consent-cases.ts` under the name "re-arms an undecided
 * interaction, which kills the ticket it replaced" — the second ticket decides,
 * the first is refused, and a decided interaction can never be re-armed at all.
 * A prefetch followed by the real navigation leaves the reader looking at the
 * LAST render, so the form in front of them is the live one. An older tab is
 * the case that loses, and it loses recoverably: `decide` matches no row, the
 * page refuses with CONSENT_NOT_DECIDABLE, and reloading arms a fresh ticket
 * because the interaction is still undecided. A refusal, not a wedge, and not
 * a second connection.
 *
 * ONE THING THAT IS NOT PROVEN EITHER WAY, recorded rather than claimed: the
 * two renders arm in whatever order they reach the database, and the order the
 * BROWSER paints them in is not that order. If the slower prefetch arms after
 * the navigation, the ticket in the form the reader is looking at is already
 * dead and their first click is refused — still recoverable by reloading, but
 * a refusal they did nothing to earn. A review raised it by reading; it has
 * NOT been reproduced, and nothing here is built on the assumption that it
 * cannot happen. Closing it means deciding where arming belongs, which is the
 * open question below, not a line to add to a uniqueness guard.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL OPEN, deliberately and separately: whether a GET render is the
 * right place for a write at all. The open question is the shape, not a known
 * defect. It is recorded rather than changed here, because moving arming out of
 * the render is a change to the consent flow's two-step — the thing the measured
 * cookie behaviour forced — and that deserves its own slice with its own
 * evidence rather than riding along with a uniqueness guard.
