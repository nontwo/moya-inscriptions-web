 * two renders of one navigation is an ordinary event rather than an exotic one:
 * both read "no connection" and both used to insert one. Measured on a
 * disposable target — two rows, same millisecond, matching the pair the Owner
 * walkthrough reported. What closes it is `createForClient`, where the unique
 * index from migration 20260921010000 decides the winner and the loser re-reads
 * the winner's row. The read here is only the fast path for the common case,
 * which is a connection that already exists.
