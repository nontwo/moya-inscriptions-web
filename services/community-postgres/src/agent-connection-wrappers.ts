/**
 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141 r14 §5) — the external token, and the
 * grant provenance that travels with it.
 *
 * r11 chose Design B and r12 proved it: `oidc-provider@9.12.2` cannot be made
 * to emit a prefixed access token, so ArtVenn mints its own opaque value and
 * keeps a mapping to the provider's own token. r13 built the table. This is
 * the code that writes and reads it.
 *
 * The single rule this file exists to make structural rather than
 * conventional:
 *
 *   **A wrapper's consent generation is read from the GRANT, never supplied by
 *   the caller and never read from the connection.**
 *
 * `mint` therefore takes a grant id and derives the connection and the
 * generation from the frozen grant row itself. A caller cannot pass the wrong
 * generation because a caller cannot pass one at all. That closes the r12
 * defect at the only place it could be reintroduced: a refresh is redeemed at
 * the provider, which knows nothing about ArtVenn's generation, so anything
 * that stamped "the current generation" at mint would hand a disconnected
 * client a token that looks freshly consented.
 *
 * The database is the second line of the same defence: the composite foreign
 * key `(grant_id, connection_id, generation)` references the grant's frozen
 * identity tuple, so a row that disagrees with its grant cannot be inserted
 * even if this code were wrong.
