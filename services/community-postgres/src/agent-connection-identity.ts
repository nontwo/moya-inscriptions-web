/**
 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141 r15) — the identity rules two services have
 * to agree on, in the one package both already depend on.
 *
 * The Admin and the authorization service each need to know what a client id
 * is and which clients are registered. They cannot import each other, and a
 * copy on each side is not a shared rule: it is two rules that agree until the
 * day one is edited. A registry the Admin validated more loosely than the
 * provider would show the Owner one client while the provider authorized
 * another — which is exactly the disagreement a consent screen exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * WHY HERE, and not in `@moya/contracts`: the Community V1 freeze (amendment
 * 2026-09-11, section 9) pins `packages/contracts/src/internal` to exactly
 * three subpaths, and a fourth is a policy change this task has no authority
 * to make. This package is the next-closest shared home — both consumers
 * already depend on it, and these rules bound values its own columns store
 * (`oauth_client_id` is CHECKed between 1 and 1024 characters right here).
 *
 * Carry-forward C2 from the r14 review named the move; the freeze named the
 * destination.
 *
 * Deliberately zod-free. This package has never depended on zod and there is
 * no reason a persistence package should start: the RULES live here as plain
 * predicates, and the one consumer that wants them as zod schemas builds those
 * from these predicates rather than the other way round.

 * Onboarding PRESETS, not a vocabulary. These three are the surfaces the Admin

 *
 * WHY THIS IS NO LONGER AN ALLOWLIST. ArtVenn is a tool service, not a client
 * directory: an approved client must be registrable through configuration, and
 * one enum value per vendor is a schema change per vendor. What decides
 * authority is the exact registered `oauth_client_id`, the human's identity,
 * the resource, the consent, the frozen scopes and the generation — none of
 * which this label touches. `admitGrant` never reads it, the grant table has
 * no column for it, and `findForClient` matches on the client id.
 *
 * So the family is now a bounded SLUG with a display `label` beside it. The
 * bound is real: it is templated into `principal_label`
 * (`agent-<family>-<12 hex>`), whose own CHECK is `^agent-[a-z0-9-]{2,57}$`,
 * so 32 characters of slug plus the fixed 19 stays inside it with room to

 * A client's redirect URIs, exactly as the provider will have to match them.

 * target is where an authorization code is delivered, so a registry that
 * accepted a remote host would be the whole flow's weakest link.
 *
 * WHAT EACH REGISTRATION BUYS BY CHOOSING `loopback-host`, stated as a
 * tradeoff rather than as a reassurance:
 *
 *   * `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` are addresses; the kernel decides what they mean
 *     and nothing in userspace can move them. `localhost` is a NAME, and a
 *     name is resolved — a hosts file, a resolver or an mDNS responder can
 *     point it somewhere else. That is the whole of the difference, and it is
 *     why `loopback-ip` stays the default.
 *   * What still holds either way: the scheme must be `http:`, the path must
 *     be a real path, there is no userinfo, no fragment and no query, and the
 *     stored form must be byte-identical to what was written — so a
 *     `localhost` registration is never quietly rewritten to an IP, and an IP
 *     registration never quietly accepts the name.
 *   * What does NOT hold, and must not be claimed: the PORT is not pinned at
 *     match time. `oidc-provider` matches a native client's loopback redirect
 *     with the RFC 8252 §7.3 ephemeral-port exception (`stripLoopbackPort` in
 *     its `models/client.js`, over the same three hosts), so any port on the
 *     registered host and path is accepted by the provider whatever this
 *     registry stores. Requiring an explicit port here is defence in depth and
 *     a readability rule — it is not a guarantee, and reading it as one would
 *     be the kind of comment this task has had to retract before.
