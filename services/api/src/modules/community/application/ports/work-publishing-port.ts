/*
 * Work publishing persistence (work-publishing-v1, design.md §2-§5, §9-§10).
 *
 * Conventions shared by every method:
 * - Ids are the opaque contract strings (`work-draft-<32hex>`, …). `actorId` is
 *   the authenticated PublicUserId; an inactive (suspended) actor, or a subject
 *   the actor does not own, throws `CommunityNotFoundError` (never a hint that
 *   the subject exists).
 * - `now` is the injected service clock. Adapters bind it as a SQL parameter
 *   for every stored time, lease, retention and America/New_York day boundary;
 *   they never read the database clock for product decisions.
 * - Commands are already strictly parsed by the service with the contract
 *   schemas. A method whose command carries `requestId` is an author command:
 *   one transaction locks the actor row, checks `author_command_receipts`
 *   (same request and same fingerprint returns the stored result; a different
 *   fingerprint throws `CommunityConflictError`), applies the change, writes
 *   one `author_events` row and the receipt. Results are therefore JSON-safe.
 * - A rule rejection throws `CommunityInputError` whose message is exactly one
 *   `WorkPublishingFailureCode` (`capacity_exceeded`, `items_limit`,
 *   `draft_limit`, `daily_limit`, `original_item_too_large`,
 *   `component_too_large`, `work_unavailable`, …). A state that moved on
 *   (stale version, late write after submit/discard, upload in progress)
 *   throws `CommunityConflictError` with a content-free message. Thrown errors
 *   roll back: nothing is stored, receipted or audited.
 * - Nothing here logs or returns titles, bodies, file names, metadata values,
 *   storage keys to clients, or tokens. Storage keys only travel to the Backend
 *   media store and worker.
