/**
 * Agent Connections V1 (Issue #141 r15 §5) — the provider, configured from
 * what r11 chose and r12 proved rather than from a fresh reading of the docs.
 *
 * Three settings here are load-bearing and each was learned the hard way, so
 * they are stated with their consequence rather than left as options:
 *
 *  - `devInteractions: { enabled: false }`. Without it the provider IGNORES
 *    `interactions.url` entirely and only warns, so consent silently goes to
 *    the quick-start screens instead of the Owner's Admin.
 *  - `prompt=consent` on the authorize request (the client's job, asserted in
 *    the tests). Without it `offline_access` does not survive consent and NO
 *    refresh token is issued — which would make the whole revocation story
 *    untestable.
 *  - The audience is on `token.aud`, NOT `token.resourceServer.audience`.
 *
 * Design B lives in `wrapAccessToken`: the provider cannot be made to emit a
 * prefixed token, so the token endpoint's successful responses are
 * post-processed and the access token replaced with an ArtVenn-minted opaque
 * value whose mapping is bound to the consent grant.

     * `prompt=consent` (`lib/actions/authorization/check_scope.js`), and the
     * default `issueRefreshToken` then declines because the granted scopes no

     * never saw this; a real native client does not, and MCP's authorization
     * profile does not tell it to. The measured consequence for such a client
     * is a 300-second access token and no way to renew it — a connection that
     * has to re-run a browser consent every five minutes, which is not a
     * connection.
     *
     * WHY IT IS NOT A CONSENT BYPASS. A refresh token is only ever issued
     * against a GRANT, and the only thing that builds a grant here is
     * `resume.ts`, after a human approved this exact connection in the Admin
     * and after the connection has actually reached the generation that
     * consent recorded. This changes what a client must remember to ASK for.
     * It does not change who approved, what they approved, or the fact that a
     * disconnect bumps the generation and kills the refreshed token on its
     * next request — which the acceptance harness proves, unchanged.
     *
     * Bounded to this deployment's own capability scope, so it is not a blanket
     * "always refresh": a grant that somehow carried neither `artvenn:read`
     * nor `offline_access` still gets nothing.
