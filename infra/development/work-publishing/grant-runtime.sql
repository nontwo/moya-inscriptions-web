-- Development App role after Phase 4 and work-publishing community migrations.
-- Apply explicitly as the setup/migration role; never from Backend startup.
-- The caller creates a non-owner NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS role first.
-- psql variable app_role is an identifier, not credential material.
-- Only runtime statements and invoker-trigger columns are granted. No DDL,
-- TRUNCATE, ownership, default privileges or ledger/identity rewrites.
-- Only receipt results and content-bearing event detail may be erased by
-- permanent deletion; event identity, action, actor and time stay immutable.
-- The Backend, authenticated operator bridge and worker share this SQL role;
-- public-user and Payload/operator authentication remain separate boundaries.

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public, community TO :"app_role";

-- Convergence of an earlier, broader grant path. A role that was first set up by
-- infra/development/grant-community-app.sql (Mission 2A/2B: table-level UPDATE on
-- sessions, both comment tables and publication_setting) or by a private Phase 4
-- plan keeps those table-level privileges, because GRANT only adds and the
-- column lists below never narrow a table-level grant. Revoke exactly the
-- table-level privileges this plan grants at column level, then grant the
-- columns again below in this same run: PostgreSQL drops the column-level
-- entries together with the table-level one, so the re-grant is required.
-- Revoking an absent privilege is a no-op, so repeated application converges
-- to the same effective set. Nothing else is revoked here; any other residue on
-- a retained role is listed for an Owner decision, never removed blindly.

-- Agent connections (Issue #141 r13): the canonical connection authority.
--
-- The App role reads connections, grants and wrappers, and may record that a
-- request was verified -- but it may NOT move a connection's lifecycle. Opening,
-- consenting, revoking and reconnecting belong to the connection-management
-- path, not to the resource server that merely authorizes a request with them.
-- So no UPDATE on status, generation, preset, principal_label or
-- current_grant_id, and no INSERT on connections at all.
--
-- A grant is an immutable consent snapshot. The App role receives no UPDATE on
-- generation_at_consent, the client, the subject, the issuer, the resource, the
-- scopes or the preset: the whole point is that an old grant keeps resolving to
-- the generation its human consented at, so nothing that would let it be
-- rewritten is granted. Only the provider-destruction columns move.
--
-- Wrappers are written and reaped by the provider path, not by the App role,
-- which only needs to resolve a presented token. Nothing is ever deleted here
-- by this role.
--
-- DELIBERATELY ABSENT: community.agent_connection_provider_artifacts gets no
-- grant at all in this file. The r13 review was right that this is a decision
-- and not an oversight, so it is written down. That table holds the OAuth
-- protocol's own bookkeeping, and its plaintext columns (grant_id,
-- consumed_at) sit outside the authenticated payload -- so who may write it
-- decides how exposed those columns are. The intent is a SECOND SQL role owned
-- by the authorization service, not this shared App role, which would widen
-- the blast radius of any injection in the resource-server path to the whole
-- token store. That role does not exist yet because the service does not, and
-- the day it lands this file stops being the whole grant plan. Until then the
-- adapter is exercised only by tests connecting as the database owner.
--
-- The same decision covers community.agent_connection_wrappers, which the App
-- role may SELECT and nothing more. A wrapper row is minted when a token is
-- issued and reaped when it expires -- both of which happen on the
-- authorization path, not the resource-server path -- so its writer is that
-- same future role. This role only has to resolve a token somebody presents.
